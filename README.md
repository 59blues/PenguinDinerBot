# penguinDiner

I am learning to automate this game, Penguin Diner, using the pyautogui module.\
Penguin Diner is played using the mouse only.\
In short, I want to create a script so this game is able to run independently without human intervention.\

Work in progress.

Inspired by Al Sweigart - Automate the Boring Stuff
