# penguinDiner

I want to automate this game called Penguin Diner, using pyautogui module. 

I initiated this project after taking on Al Sweigart's programming course - Automate the boring stuff with python. 

In short, pyautogui will control the mouse cursor and run the game on its own, without human interaction.


!!! This project is still in progress
